# Prediction of employee attrition with AI
Employees leaving companies involve costs associated with separation, temporary loss of productivity, recruitment and interviewing candidates as well as training and onboarding of new employees. Overall, losing an employee is a matter of money, time and reduces team cohesion. Therefore, in this project, AI models are used to predict whether an employee will leave as well as the number of years in the company. Furthermore, employee data is analyzed in order to find which factors are the most influential when it comes to employee attrition.
